Python scripts written for a assignment in my Computer Animation class. These scripts were made to be used in Maya. The Maya files they were used on are also provided. 

ParentConstraint.py takes at least three selected objects, makes the first object the parent, and makes the other objects children to the parent object. This script was used by clips.mb. 

LightIntensity.py takes all lights found in a scene and sets their intensity to be 1.75 times brighter by the end of the frames. This script was used by LightIntensity.mb.
